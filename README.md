# About-AppClips
Gathering all info published, both by Apple and by others, about new feature App Clips.



An **App Clip** is a lightweight version of your app that lets people perform everyday tasks quickly, without downloading and installing your app. People discover and launch App Clips in a variety of situations and contexts. At a physical location, people launch an App Clip by scanning an NFC tag or a visual code. On their device, they launch an App Clip from location-based suggestions from Siri Suggestions, the Maps app, or Smart App Banners on websites, and by tapping links others share with them in the Messages app.



We provide a website **[AppClips Hub](https://appclipshub.com/)** to show your appclips application, welcome to submit.
